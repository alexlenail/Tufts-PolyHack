							Designer vs Hacker?
						</div>	
						<div class="lists">
						<ul>
						<li>usually takes longer to build the tech than to design, so we will also have mini design competitions at night to keep designers on their toes</li>
						<li>Facebook portfolio review</li>
						<li>you can be both and still submit to the design contests</li>
