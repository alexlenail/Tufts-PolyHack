# Tufts-PolyHack

### Current things that need doing:
- <s>Add a bar at the bottom (using bootstrap) which is also a scrollspy.</s>
- <s>Add a set of content divs below the header</s>
    * <s>Mission Statement</s>
    * <s>General Information</s>
    * <s>Some other stuff</s>
- <s>finish the flicker animation of the header</s>
- <s>position the header nicely, logo over the triangles</s>
- <s>have a fallback image in case we don't want to do the crazy animation thing (e.g. for phones)</s>

If you're adding a new directory with static resources, make sure you update `ap.yaml` and add it to the list of static directories! Otherwise Google App Engine will throw an error and autodeploy will not work.
