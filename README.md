# Tufts-PolyHack

This is the repository for the website [2015.polyhack.tufts.io](http://2015.polyhack.tufts.io), and my hope is that it can serve as the basis for next year's Polyhack website, 2016.polyhack.tufts.io.

This hackathon was an extraordinary endeavour put on by a large group of organizers who made everything possible, and I had the great honor of leading to put on this spectacular event. Thanks to Richard Kim, Arthur Berman, Alice Lee, Jared Moskowitz, Logan Garbarini, Max Bernstein, Kate Wasynczuk, Bruno Olmedo Quiroga, and Alex Gould for helping put together this event.

### Current things that need doing:
- <s>Add a bar at the bottom (using bootstrap) which is also a scrollspy.</s>
- <s>Add a set of content divs below the header</s>
    * <s>Mission Statement</s>
    * <s>General Information</s>
    * <s>Some other stuff</s>
- <s>finish the flicker animation of the header</s>
- <s>position the header nicely, logo over the triangles</s>
- <s>have a fallback image in case we don't want to do the crazy animation thing (e.g. for phones)</s>

If you're adding a new directory with static resources, make sure you update `ap.yaml` and add it to the list of static directories! Otherwise Google App Engine will throw an error and autodeploy will not work.
